Raising Susan is a tender, browser-based life simulator built in one HTML file. You play as a parent guiding Susan from her first breath in the hospital to her high school graduation at 18. Through simple choices—feeding, playing, reading—you influence her stats (Love, Smarts, Happiness, Health), which shape her personality and future. At the end, witness her journey unfold in a personalized life gallery. No downloads, no ads—just a quiet, meaningful experience made with love by Sweet Biscuit44. ❤️ �
